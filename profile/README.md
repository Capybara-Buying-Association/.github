## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Capybara Buying Association Coding Club!

First off, please [join our Discord Server!](https://discord.gg/U5kdyjVMeY) Its where we'll be sending out updates, organising projects as well as showing off stuff that we've made! 

## Why does this exist?

There are lots of people who have many ideas for projects and there are lots of people who want to work on projects but don't know where to start. Why not take this opportunity to collaborate together on a real project that helps you learn and apply new skills?

By collaborating with other people, we can tap into their expertise and get exposure to new areas that we otherwise would not have. It also gives us a chance to connect with like-minded individuals that share the same interests that we do! 

We want you to get out of your comfort zone so don't be afraid to reach out. Feel free to ask as many questions as you can and make sure you get involved!

We'll get into contact with you as soon as possible and will add your project to the projects list so that other people can get involved who also may be interested.  

## How to maintain a repository 

Once you have your project on the projects list, you will be given a repository in the org that you will maintain. While it is up to you as to how well the repository is maintained, we reccommend using this as a learning opportunity by attempting to use best practices. These include:

- **Regular Updates**: Keep your repository up to date by regularly committing and pushing changes. This helps ensure that the latest code is available to collaborators and users.

- **Clear Documentation**: Document your project thoroughly, including a README file that provides an overview, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information. This helps users understand your project and encourages contributions.

- **Version Control**: Use Git's version control features effectively. Create branches for new features or bug fixes, and merge them back into the main branch (e.g., `master` or `main`) once they are tested and ready.

- **Issue Tracking**: Utilize GitHub's issue tracking system to manage bug reports, feature requests, and other tasks. Encourage users and collaborators to submit issues and provide timely responses.

- **Code Reviews**: Foster a culture of code reviews by encouraging collaborators to review each other's code. This helps identify and address potential issues, improves code quality, and promotes knowledge sharing.

- **Continuous Integration**: Set up a continuous integration (CI) system to automatically build, test, and deploy your project. This ensures that changes are validated and integrated smoothly.

- **Security Considerations**: Regularly review and update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities. Follow security best practices, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and restricting access to sensitive information.

- **Licensing**: Choose an appropriate open-source license for your project to define how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. Include the license file in your repository.

- **Community Engagement**: Engage with your community by responding to issues, pull requests, and questions promptly. Encourage collaboration and provide guidance to new contributors. Also, share updates along the way!
